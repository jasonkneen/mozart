                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
remains free software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify it.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for the other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are committed to the
principle that helping the other free software developers means
considering the community's needs.

  With the GNU Affero General Public License, you have the freedom to:

  0. To run the program for any purpose (section 0).
  1. To study how the program works and change it so it does what you wish
     (section 1).
  2. To copy and distribute copies of the modified version to others so they
     can benefit from your improvements (section 2).
  3. To distribute modified versions of the program so that others can benefit
     from the changes (section 3).

The stated goals are achieved through the use and enforcement of the GNU
Affero General Public License.

  When you receive a work covered by the GNU Affero General Public License
("covered work"), you have certain responsibilities. The responsibility is
to respect the freedom of others who will receive copies of the work from you.

  For the details of those obligations, please read the full AGPL-3.0 license
